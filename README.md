# Melanoma Detection Using Computer Vision
> A computer vision project using CNN architecture to correctly classify 9 skin conditions inclusive of melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. This model is not meant for use in making medical decisions but simply serves as an example of how to build a CNN with parallel convolutions in hidden layers along with densely connected layers.  


## General Information
* Computer Vision Project
* Libraries used - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Tensorflow, Keras, Augmentor

> Note the original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic), the dataset within this repo includes augmented images created using the original dataset.
